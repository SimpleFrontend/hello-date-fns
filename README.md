This project was a simple app that allows the participatns of the [Front-end Challenge](https://www.facebook.com/groups/173311386703334/) to check their records. I used [moment-timezone](https://momentjs.com/timezone/) to calculate the timestamp of the submission to determine if the submission is made in time.
